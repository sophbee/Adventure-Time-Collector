# week-4-game

This is a homework assignment that uses jQuery and Javascript to put together a game that generates a random number the user must match using the princess buttons, which also hold randomly generated numbers. The user does not know what the numbers are for each princess until it is clicked on. Using that knowledge, the right set of princesses need to be chosen in order to match the target score. 
This project helped me use my newly acquired knowledge of jQuery to make event listeners for each button when clicked on as well as create variables specifically used for jQuery to make my code look neat(er). The majority of this exercise was to review JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS so I could strengthen my ability to use them outside of the classroom environment. Users can recreate this project by playing the game found on my GitHub project page. Currently, I am the only one who is maintaining and contributing to this project. As I learn more, I will update accordingly.
